          <h2 id="sec1">1. Choosing the moat</h2>
          <p>
            In regulated markets you can’t out-discount or out-feature incumbents overnight. What you
            can do is out-explain them. We decided early that our moat would be <strong>clarity</strong>:
            better breakdowns of rules, workflows and edge cases than anyone else.
          </p>

          <h2 id="sec2">2. Designing the architecture</h2>
          <p>
            Instead of random blogs, we built a tree:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Top-level guides for each regulation and geography.</li>
            <li>Deep dives for every process step merchants cared about.</li>
            <li>Playbooks that linked the regulation to our product features.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Every article linked up, down and sideways. That linking, plus consistent schema, is a big
            part of why we captured so many long-tail searches.
          </p>

          <h2 id="sec3">3. Editorial cadence & quality bar</h2>
          <p>
            We shipped weekly at first, then moved to a steady but slower cadence once the backbone
            was built. The rule was simple: if an article didn’t genuinely help a practitioner do
            their job, we didn’t publish it.
          </p>

          <h2 id="sec4">4. Measuring compounding value</h2>
          <p>
            Within a year, organic became the largest contributor of opportunities and helped reduce
            paid CAC by double digits. But the most interesting signal was sales behaviour – reps
            started using articles as part of their follow-ups and demos.
          </p>
          <p>
            That’s the real sign of a moat: when content stops being “marketing collateral” and
            becomes part of how the product is sold and understood.
