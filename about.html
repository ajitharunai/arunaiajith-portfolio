          <p class="about-lead">
            I grew from hands-on engineering and AI research into product, SEO and GTM – 
            and now operate as a single person who can think like an architect, write like a marketer 
            and execute like an IC.
          </p>
          <p class="about-body">
            My work lives where complex products meet real business constraints. 
            I like messy markets, ambiguous roadmaps and teams that care about compounding results, 
            not vanity metrics. Most of my time goes into building systems: search engines, 
            content moats, narratives, and experiments that stack on top of each other.

            <li><strong>Strategy must speak numbers.</strong> Traffic, SQLs, pipeline or retention — every idea connects to a metric we care about.</li>
            <li><strong>Deep work over busy work.</strong> Fewer projects, done properly, with clear before/after impact.</li>
            <li><strong>Systems, not one-offs.</strong> Every asset we create should unlock three more opportunities later.</li>
            <li><strong>Low ego, high context.</strong> I work best with teams who are honest about constraints and open about feedback.</li>
